This game is a 2.5D game that puts its main focus on core flight mechanics and the vector motions of the obstacles. To move the obstacles, I used sinusoidal calculations to serve as an oscillator. In this game, you play as an explorer and the aim is to maneuver a rocket ship by rotating and thrusting, as it flies through over numerous unique atmospheric levels through the ruins of Sun Temple.
